# JS Fundamentals

A concise guide and roadmap to learn core JavaScript concepts, practice exercises, and small projects.

## Purpose
Provide a clear set of topics, setup steps, exercises, and project ideas to build a strong foundation in JavaScript.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of command line and text editor.
- Node.js installed (recommended LTS).

## Setup
1. Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
2. Optional: initialize a project
    - npm init -y
    - npm install --save-dev eslint
3. Run simple script:
    - node path/to/file.js

## Learning Objectives
- Understand JavaScript syntax and runtime behavior
- Work with data types, control flow, functions, objects, and arrays
- Use modern ES6+ features (let/const, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, modules)
- Manipulate the DOM and handle events (browser)
- Handle asynchronous code (callbacks, Promises, async/await)
- Write small tests and debug code

## Topics Covered
- Syntax & comments
- Primitives and reference types
- Variables: var, let, const
- Operators and expressions
- Control flow: if, switch, loops
- Functions: declarations, expressions, arrow functions
- Scope & closures
- Objects & prototypes
- Arrays and common methods (map, filter, reduce)
- ES6+ features (classes, modules, spread/rest)
- DOM manipulation & events (querySelector, addEventListener)
- Asynchronous JS: callbacks, Promises, async/await, setTimeout
- Fetch / HTTP basics
- Error handling: try/catch, throwing errors
- Basic testing with a simple framework (e.g., Jest or built-in assertions)
- Debugging techniques

## Exercises (progressive)
1. Hello world: log and template literal
2. Calculator: functions for add/sub/mul/div
3. Array tasks: sum, unique, flatten
4. Object tasks: merge, deep clone (shallow vs deep)
5. Closure: create a counter function
6. Async: wrap setTimeout in a Promise
7. Fetch: GET JSON from a public API and print titles
8. DOM: build a dynamic list with add/remove

## Mini Projects
- To‑Do App (CRUD in browser, localStorage)
- Quiz App (questions, scoring, timer)
- Weather Fetcher (fetch API, display results)
- Simple REST client in Node (axios/fetch)

## Recommended Workflow
- Keep small commits with clear messages
- Write tests for logic-heavy functions
- Use linters and formatters (ESLint, Prettier)
- Prefer modular code and small functions

## Resources
- MDN JavaScript Guide — https://developer.mozilla.org/
- ECMAScript specification overview — https://www.ecma-international.org/
- Node.js docs — https://nodejs.org/
- Free interactive tutorials and docs (practice sites)

## Contribution
- Create a branch, add exercises or improvements, open a PR with a short description.

## License
Add a license file as needed (MIT recommended for learning repos).
